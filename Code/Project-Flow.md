# Project Workflow: Earthquake Magnitude Prediction

## Steps Completed So Far
1. **Data Download and Understanding**:
   - Downloaded the STEAD dataset in chunks (Chunk2 to Chunk6).
   - Each chunk contains HDF5 files with waveform data and CSV files with metadata.

2. **Data Categorization**:
   - Categorized waveforms into magnitude ranges (`2-3`, `3-4`, `4-5`, `5-6`, `6+`) based on `source_magnitude`.
   - Created JSON files for each chunk containing categorized waveform names.

3. **Waveform Extraction**:
   - Loaded waveform data from HDF5 files using the categorization in JSON files.
   - Saved categorized waveforms as `.npy` files for each magnitude range.

4. **Prepared Dataset Overview**:
   - Verified the number of waveforms in each category and identified class imbalance.

5. **Dataset Preparation**
   - **Balance Dataset**:
     - Use downsampling for overrepresented categories (`2-3`, `3-4`).
     - Use oversampling or augmentation for underrepresented categories (`5-6`, `6+`).
   - **Combine Data**:
     - Merge all `.npy` files into a single dataset.
   - **Split Data**:
     - Split the dataset into training (70%), validation (20%), and test (10%) sets.

6. **Data Normalization**
   - Normalize waveforms to a fixed range (e.g., -1 to 1).
   - Ensure all waveforms have consistent lengths (e.g., resample to 1000 timesteps).

7. **Model Design**
   - **Architecture**:
     - Use a CNN-GRU architecture:
       - CNN layers for spatial feature extraction.
       - GRU layers for modeling temporal dependencies.
       - Output a single value for magnitude prediction using a linear activation.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Implement the model using TensorFlow or PyTorch.

8. **Model Training**
   - Compile the model:
     - Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
     - Optimizer: Adam.
     - Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
   - Train the model using the prepared training and validation sets.
   - Use early stopping to prevent overfitting.

9. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model on the test set.
   - Metrics to calculate:
     - MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
     - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

## Next Steps
### 1. **Model Optimization**
   - Tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of GRU units, filter sizes).
   - Experiment with dropout and regularization techniques to improve generalization.

### 2. **Save and Deploy**
   - Save the trained model in `.h5` format.
   - Develop a pipeline for real-time seismic waveform predictions.

### 3. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - Document all steps, code, and results.
   - Prepare visualizations for the dataset, model performance, and error analysis.

### 4. **Future Enhancements**
   - Extend the model to predict aftershocks or other earthquake parameters.
   - Integrate additional metadata (e.g., location, depth) to improve predictions.

## Note
Each step should be implemented iteratively, ensuring the data and model quality are maintained at every stage. Let me know if you'd like detailed guidance on any specific step!
