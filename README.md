# Earthquake Magnitude Prediction

## Project Description
Early detection and accurate forecasting of earthquakes are vital for minimizing their impact on human life and infrastructure. This project proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model that enhances earthquake prediction by integrating 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNNs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and a Transfer Learning-inspired training strategy.

The 1D-CNN component extracts spatial features from raw seismic signals, while GRUs effectively capture temporal dependencies within the time-series data. To improve model performance and stability, a checkpoint-based Transfer Learning approach is utilized, enabling the model to resume training from previously learned states, reducing convergence time and preserving valuable feature representations.

Using the Stanford Earthquake Dataset (STEAD), which includes real-world noisy seismic data, the model demonstrates strong robustness and adaptability in practical scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Replacing LSTMs with GRUs enhances processing speed without compromising performance, making the model particularly well-suited for real-time deployment. This research contributes significantly to the development of early warning systems by providing rapid and accurate earthquake detection. By improving real-time forecasting capabilities, the model supports disaster preparedness, enables timely evacuations, and enhances risk mitigation strategiesâ€”ultimately helping to save lives and reduce the economic toll of earthquakes.
