# Earthquake Magnitude Prediction

## Project Description
This project predicts the magnitude of earthquakes using historical seismic data. The goal is to utilize machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost to build a model that predicts earthquake magnitudes based on various features such as location, depth, and past earthquake data. The model aims to provide accurate predictions that can help in understanding seismic activities.
